Lots of apps and websites require that users create an account, maybe to store user preferences, user data or to allow for special permissions. Orchard comes with user accounts built in and all we want to do is extend it a little to make this functionality available to our mobile client apps.

To do so we'll create an Orchard Module which can be dropped into any Orchard project. The module will contain an API AccountController with a /Register endpoint for creating new accounts. There will also be an OAuth /Token endpoint for logging in with a username and password and receiving a valid access token in return.

We'll be using the [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.3](Resource Owner Password Credentials) OAuth flow. Which means the user types their Orchard username and password directly into your app which are sent off to your Orchard website and exchanged for an access token. We won't implement refresh tokens because mobile apps can't easily keep a client secret which would be required for refresh tokens. You just have to set an expiry time on the access tokens that you're comfortable with.

**Source Code**

The Morphous.TokenAuth module can be used in any Orchard project, you don't need the Morphous.Orchard fork for it to work:

And here is a blog post from bitoftech.net about Owin, OAuth and tokens which helped me a lot when I first started on this topic. My post will be similar in lots of ways but built up around Orchard instead of ASP.NET Identity.
